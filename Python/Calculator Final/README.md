# Project 3: Caluclator Final

### Introduction
This program is designed to be a normal two number caluclator. 
It can only do simple functions for now (only +, -, *, /)

### Summary
This project will be a GUI made from tkinter with a label with the output with a bunch of buttons with numbers and operations.
You start by clicking a number and then a operator (+, -, *, or /) and the label will change.
As opposed to most calculators, this calculator can only handle two numbers at a time. For example, you can't do 1+1+1=3, you can only do do 1+1=2.

### Running
There are multiple ways to run this.
The easiest might be to open Microsoft Visual Studio and copy the text in Calculator.py into a new python project.
You can also download Python from www.python.org and run it using that, although you have to be aware of where you downloaded it.
For me, it downloaded in C:\Users\*MyUserName*\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38
Open the .py file with the python.exe that you downloaded and it should work.

### Goals of Project
My goals for this project were to build upon my unserstanding of Python and tKinter, which I believe I have achieved.
I built upon my last model to make it seem more calculator like.
Because of this change in design, I gained more experience with tKinter layout, classes and global variables. I also gained experience with more complex programs.

- I used a function from here to drop trailing zeros off of my numbers.

- I used most of the code from this as a blueprint for the general tkinter GUI layout and design.

- Showed me how to change the text in a label. I added this in here because it took me about an hour to figure out.
