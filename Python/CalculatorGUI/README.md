# Project 2: Caluclator GUI

### Introduction
This program is designed to be a normal two number caluclator. 
It can only do simple functions for now (only +, -, *, /, and ^).

### Summary
This project will be a GUI made from tkinter with a box for the first number, operator, and second number.
After you put in your numbers and operator, you then clock the Calculate button.
The math function and awnser will then be placed in a label below the button.
There is error checking for divide by zero, and bad input for the numbers and operator.
When the error is caught it will output a message in the label below the calculate button.

### Running
There are multiple ways to run this.
The easiest might be to open Microsoft Visual Studio and copy the text in Calculator.py into a new python project.
You can also download Python from www.python.org and run it using that, although you have to be aware of where you downloaded it.
For me, it downloaded in C:\Users\*MyUserName*\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38
Open the .py file with the python.exe that you downloaded and it should work.

### Goals of Project
My goals for this project were to get a basic understanding of Python GUI.
This project will lead me into project three, where I plan to make something that looks more similar to a calculator and can handle more numbers and functions.

- I used a function from here to drop trailing zeros off of my numbers.

- I used most of the code from this as a blueprint for the general tkinter GUI layout and design.

- Showed me how to change the text in a label. I added this in here because it took me about an hour to figure out.
