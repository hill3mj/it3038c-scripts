This program is designed to be a normal integer caluclator. 
It can only do simple functions for now (only +, -, *, and /).
It should ask for the operation and then ask for 2 numbers, and then run the operation. 
It will keep on running until the user tells it to stop, by typing N when prompted.

There are multiple ways to run this.
The easiest might be to just open it with a Python editor, like Microsoft Visual Studio, and run it from there.
You can also download Python from www.python.org and run it using that, although you have to be aware of where you downloaded it.
For me it downloaded in C:\Users\*MyUserName*\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38
Open the .py file with the python.exe that you downloaded and it should work.

The goal for me for this project was to get a basic understanding of Python because I have never used it before.
I think I got a basic understanding of the syntax and basic techniques like if/else, error catching, creating functions and using tabs to group code (which was a little weird).
